   \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nGUN is a realtime, distributed, offline-first, graph database engine. Lightweight and powerful, at just ~9KB gzipped.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nRealtime - It may be trivial to get realtime updates with socket.io or something, but what you do not get is state synchronization. GUN does this for you out of the box, assuring that two users' simultaneous updates won't concurrently break each other.\nDistributed - GUN is peer-to-peer by design, meaning you have no centralized database server to maintain or that could crash. This lets you sleep through the night without worrying about database DevOps - we call this \"NoDB\". From that, you can build decentralized, federated, or centralized apps.\nOffline-first - GUN works even if your internet or cell reception doesn't. Users can still plug away and save data as normal, and then when the network comes back online GUN will automatically synchronize all the changes and handle any conflicts for you.\nGraph - Most databases force you to bend over backwards to match their storage constraints. But graphs are different, they let you have any data structure you want. Whether that be traditional tables with relations, document oriented trees, or tons of circular references. You choose.\n\nQuickstart\nTry the interactive tutorial in the browser (5min ~ average developer). Or run the NodeJS demo example apps (5min ~ average developer).\nJump right into the gun playground and start testing whatever functions you want.\nQuick note: All active development is happening on 0.5 branch, which has the upcoming 30M+ ops/sec performance improvements!\nDemos\n\nOnline example applications\nThe above examples are included in this repo. You can run them locally by running the following commands in your terminal or on your command line:\n\nNote: If you don't have node or npm, read this first.\n\nnpm install gun\ncd node_modules/gun\nnode examples/http.js 8080\n\nThen visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser. \nIf that did not work it is probably because npm installed it to a global directory. To fix that try mkdir node_modules in your desired directory and re-run the above commands. You also might have to add sudo in front of the commands.\n\n\nVideos\n\nFault tolerance (01:01)\nSaving relational or document based data (06:59)\nEverything you want to know about GUN (57:50) 2x speed recommended.\nGUN's YouTube channel also has videos.\n\nProjects\n\nGUN users are encouraged to add their projects to this running projects list.\n\nDocs & Tradeoffs\n\nGetting Started with GUN) Guide. \nAPI documentation) and examples' source code.\nGUN is an AP system which means you should not use it for banking apps, learn more here.\nCheck out and add example code snippets) âincluding micro-modulesâ to address specific situations.\n\nModules\nGUN is designed to be as minimal as possible, with any additional functionality being provided via modules.

It will also be a great introductory guide on how to use pretty much every one of GUN's API methods.\n\nNote: This article requires gun v0.5.x or above.\n\nFirst let's instantiate the database.\nvar gun = Gun();\n\nThen we'll add some people to our database using a simple key/value approach.\nvar alice = gun.get('person/alice').put({name: 'alice', age: 22});\nvar bob = gun.get('person/bob').put({name: 'bob', age: 24});\nvar carl = gun.get('person/carl').put({name: 'carl', age: 16});\nvar dave = gun.get('person/dave').put({name: 'dave', age: 42});\n\n\nNote: If no data is found on the key ('person/alice', etc.) when we .get it, gun will implicitly create and update it upon a .put. This is useful and convenient, but can be problematic for some types of apps. If you want to check if the data does not exist, use .not first.\n\nWhat if we want to get their data? We can either chain off of the reference directly or get it again:\nalice.on(function(node){\n  console.log('Subscribed to Alice!', node);\n});\n\ngun.get('person/bob').val(function(node){\n  console.log('Bob!', node);\n});\n\n\nNote: GUN is a functional reactive database for streaming event driven data, gotta hate buzzwords - right? This means that .on subscribes to realtime updates, and may get called many times. Meanwhile .val grabs the data once, which is useful for procedural operations. \n\nNow lets add all the people into a set), you can think of this as a table in relational databases or a collection in NoSQL databases.\nvar people = gun.get('people');\npeople.set(alice);\npeople.set(bob);\npeople.set(carl);\npeople.set(dave);\n\n\nNote: .get and .put are the core API of gun, everything else is just a convenient utility that wraps around them for specific uses - like .set for inserting records.\n\nIt is now easy to iterate through our list of people.\npeople.map().val(function(person){\n  console.log(\"The person is\", person);\n});\n\n\nNote: If .map is given no callback, it simply iterates over each item in the list \"as is\" - thus acting like a for each loop in javascript. Also, everything is continuously evaluating in GUN, including .map, so it will get called when new items are added as well as when an item is updated. It does not iterate through the whole list again every time, just the changes. This is great for realtime applications.\n\nNext we want to add a startup that some of these people work at. Document oriented data does a perfect job at capturing the hierarchy of a company. Let's do that with the following:\nvar company = gun.get('startup/hype').put({\n  name: \"hype\",\n  profitable: false,\n  address: {\n    street: \"123 Hipster Lane\",\n    city: \"San Francisco\",\n    state: \"CA\",\n    country: \"USA\"\n  }\n});\n\nNow let's read it out!\ncompany.val(function(startup){\n  console.log(\"The startup:\", startup);\n});\n\n\nNote: The data given in the callback is only 1 layer deep to keep things fast. What you'll see logged out on startup.address is not the address itself, but a pointer to the address. Because documents can be of any depth, GUN only streams out what you need by default, thus optimizing bandwidth.\n\nSo what if you want to actually access the city property on the company's address then? .path lets you traverse into your document using the standard dot notation syntax popular in javascript and document databases.\ncompany.path('address.city').val(function(value, key){\n  console.log(\"What is the city?\", value);\n});\n\n\nNote: Sometimes a property name might have a '.' in it itself, like if a decimal 0.33 is used as the field. This is okay, because .path just wraps around .get. So you can escape the decimal by doing company.get('address').get('city') instead. Also, the key in the callback is always the last property name in the field path.\n\nGood news! We just found out the company got funding and moved to a new office! Let's go ahead and update it.\ngun.get('startup/hype').put({ // or you could do `company.put({` instead.\n  funded: true,\n  address: {\n    street: \"999 Expensive Boulevard\"\n  }\n});\n\n\nNote: GUN saves everything as a partial update, so you do not have to re-save the entire object every time (in fact, this should be avoided)! It automatically merges the updates for you by doing conflict resolution on the data. This lets us update only the pieces we want without worrying about overwriting the whole document.\n\nHowever documents in isolation are not very useful. Let's connect things and turn everything into a graph!\nvar employees = company.path('employees');\nemployees.set(dave);\nemployees.set(alice);\nemployees.set(bob);\n\nalice.path('spouse').put(bob);\nbob.path('spouse').put(alice);\n\nalice.path('spouse').path('employer').put(company);\nalice.path('employer').put(company);\n\ndave.path('kids').set(carl);\ncarl.path('dad').put(dave);\n\ncarl.path('friends').set(alice);\ncarl.path('friends').set(bob);\n\n\nNote: We can have 1-1, 1-N, N-N relationships. By default every relationship is a \"directed\" graph (it only goes in one direction), so if you want bi-directional relationships you must explicitly save the data as being so (like with Dave and his kid, Carl). If you want to have meta information about the relationship, simply create an \"edge\" node that both properties point to instead. Many graph databases do this by default, but because not all data structures require it, gun leaves it to you to specify.\n\nFinally, let's read some data out. Starting with getting a key/value, then navigating into a document, then mapping over a table, then traversing into one of the columns and printing out all the values!\ngun.get('person/alice').path('spouse.employer.employees').map().path('name').val(function(data, key){\n  console.log(\"The employee's\", key, data);\n});\n\nAwesome, now run it all together: http://jsbin.com/mivaciwupa/edit?js,console (Hit \"Run\", all logs except for the last one have been commented out).\nGUN is that easy! And it all syncs in realtime across devices! Imagine what you can build?\n\nBe it distributed machine learning with gun!\n\nOr IoT apps with timeseries analysis and live temperature data visualizations.\n\nHow about multiplayer VR experiences, or React apps like online games? Or realtime GPS tracking for autonomous drones that deliver burritos or Uber/Lyft like apps. \n\nMaybe you just want to create a social networking app, getting started with a basic server and using Angular or Webcomponents/Polymer instead. Better learn about P2P logins, security, and authentication with our 1 minute video explainers crash course on encryption!\n\n\nWhatever it is (except for banking), we hope you are excited and tackle it with gun! Make sure you join the chat room (everybody is nice and helpful there) and ask questions or complain about bugs/problems. Or if you think your company might be interested in using gun, we have some great partnership plans (as well as some donation options, if you want to personally contribute some yummy meals to our tummy)!\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started (v0.3.x)\nHaven't read the crash course yet?

GUN lets you focus on the data you need to store, retrieve and share without worrying about merge conflicts, network partitions, or synchronizing offline edits.\nOffline-First\nWhen a browser peer sends a request, it'll merge the responses with it's own model using our conflict resolution, then cache the result. Since it's cached on the client, there are a few interesting side effects:\n\nThe next time the client sends that request, the response is instantaneous, even when offline.\nData is replicated on each client that requests it.\nIf your server catastrophically fails, you can still recover your data from the clients.\n\nThis makes the loss of important information nearly impossible, as all copies of the data must be destroyed for it to be unrecoverable.\nServers act pretty much the same, but aren't as picky about what they cache.\nDistributed\nGUN is peer-to-peer (multi-master replicated), meaning updates don't need a centralized controller. You save data on one machine, and you can sync it with other peers without needing complex consensus systems. It just works.\nHowever, you don't need peers or servers to use GUN, they're completely additive. Here's an example of GUN running in a browser without connecting to any peers...\nHello World - Browser\n\nFollow along! Paste this code into an index.html file.\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n        \n        Hello World - GUN\n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n\n        // We're not connecting to any peers\n        // just yet...\n        var peers = [];\n        var gun = Gun(peers);\n\n        // Create an interface for the `greetings`\n        // key, storing it in a variable.\n        var greetings = gun.get('greetings');\n\n        // Update the value on `greetings`.\n        greetings.put({ hello: 'world' });\n\n        // Read the value and listen for\n        // any changes.\n        greetings.on(function (data) {\n            console.log('Update!', data)\n        })\n        \n    \n\n\nHello World - Node.js\n\nNote: If you don't have node or npm installed, read this.\n\nBefore writing any node code, install the gun library:\n$ npm install gun\n\n\nPlug this into a hello.js file.\n\n// Import the gun library\nvar Gun = require('gun');\n\n// Create a new gun instance\nvar gun = Gun();\n\n// Read `greetings`, saving it to a variable.\nvar greetings = gun.get('greetings');\n\n// Update the value on `greetings`.\ngreetings.put({\n    hello: 'world',\n})\n\n// Print the value!\ngreetings.on(function (update) {\n    console.log('Update:', update)\n})\n\nNow we run the program. It should have the same result as the browser (albeit a bit more verbose):\n# Tell node to run `hello.js`.\n$ node ./hello.js\n\nNow we've got two hello-world examples, one on Node and one on a browser. Why not sync them in real-time?\nReal-Time Sync\nHere's where the fun begins! We're gonna take the Node.js demo and sync it with the browser.\nWhen you call require('gun'), some extra server-side plugins are loaded too, and one of those is wsp.js, a websocket transport plugin that falls back to ajax polling. Since it's already included, we can call gun.wsp(server), passing it an http.Server instance.\nLet's put this in our hello.js file, right at the top.\n// `http` is a standard library\n// built into node.\nvar http = require('http');\n\n// Create a new server instance.\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\n// Our GUN setup from the last example.\nvar Gun = require('gun');\nvar gun = Gun({web: server});\n\n// Start the server on port 8080.\nserver.listen(8080, function () {\n  console.log('Server listening on http://localhost:8080/gun')\n})\n\n// ... The rest of `hello.js` ...\n\nSweet! Now gun is accepting websocket connections through http://localhost:8080/gun. Now we can connect to it from our browser and sync stuff.\nBack in index.html, lets add that url to our list of peers, the array we passed to Gun constructor...\n// ... html setup above ...\n\n// This points to the server we\n// just started.\nvar peers = [\n  'http://localhost:8080/gun',\n]\n\n// Set up gun, same as before.\nvar gun = Gun(peers);\n\n// ... the rest of index.html ...\n\nMake sure the server is running ($ node ./hello.js), then open up index.html in a browser window. Try this in your browser console:\ngreetings.put({\n  browser: 'Hello, Node!',\n})\n\nCheck back to your server - since we had it console.log updates, you should see the data. But this isn't limited to just node... open up index.html in another browser. Since they're both syncing with the server, you'll see real-time updates on both browser windows.\nGraph Structures\nThroughout our examples, we've only used simple objects. But what happens when you need to represent richer data, like page hierarchy, social networks, or a machine learning model?\nGraphs can represent any structure, no matter how complex or interconnected. In fact, that's how JavaScript objects work under the hood, which is why you can do weird infinite self-references without breaking your computer:\nvar object = {};\nobject.self = object;\n\nobject.self.self.self.self; //.....\n\nGUN uses graphs internally, so anything representable as a JavaScript object can also be saved into gun. Well, not quite everything. If you want more detail, you can read more about graphs here.\nLet's try something a bit more fun. You'll need your browser open to index.html...\n// Update to a nested object.\ngreetings.put({\n  hello: {\n    browser: 'Hey everyone!'\n  }\n})\n\nNow you should see something different this time. Instead of the usual object with hello: 'world', it'll point to a weird-looking object like this:\n{ \"#\": \"98VORPhZQhhUeNJaDdneuiGE\" }\n\nYou don't have to worry about what that is, gun uses it to figure out how objects are connected. This is where we introduce a new method called .path, which is used to navigate an object's properties.\nWe'll use the path#path) method to read the value on hello.\n// Get the property \"hello\" on greetings.\nvar hello = greetings.path('hello');\n\n// Listen for data on `greetings.hello`\nhello.on(function (value) {\n  console.log('Update:', value)\n})\n\n\nIf you don't want to listen for updates, you can use .val() instead, which works the same as .on() but is only called once.\n\nLet's go crazy and put a circular reference in there, just for fun. We'll link the hello object to itself.\n// Write the `hello` reference to the\n// property \"self\".\nhello.path('self').put(hello);\n\nTo drive the point home, let's print out the circular reference:\nvar self = hello.path('self.self.self.self');\n\n// Print the value on `self`\nself.on(function (update) {\n  console.log('Self:', update)\n})\n\nIt should log the hello object.\nNow let's think about why you'd ever want to do that. Self references aren't something you generally want... right? Not so, let's give some concrete examples!\nSocial Features\nBob is a new user on MyFace™, and his profile looks a bit like this:\nvar bob = {\n  name: 'Bob Carlson IV',\n  friends: {},\n}\n\nHe's just sent a friend request to Alice, also a new user.\nvar alice = {\n  name: 'Alice Davison',\n  friends: {},\n}\n\nOnce Alice accepts, they add each other to their friends list, and you've got a circular reference going, since they both reference each other. Check this out:\n// This could go on forever.....\nvar alice = bob.friends.alice.friends.bob.friends.alice;\n\nIn GUN\nGUN can do this easily. You can try it out in your browser console!\n// Get a reference to Bob's profile.\nvar bob = gun.get('bob');\n\n// Update Bob's information\nbob.put({\n  name: 'Bob Carlson IV',\n  friends: {},\n})\n\n// Same thing for Alice\nvar alice = gun.get('alice');\nalice.put({\n  name: 'Alice Davison',\n  friends: {},\n})\n\n// New method `.set()`: Adds the item to\n// a list. Similar to a mathematical \"set\",\n// where each member is unique.\nalice.path('friends').set(bob);\n\n// Same thing for bob.\nbob.path('friends').set(alice);\n\n// Print out Bob's name. Very inefficiently.\nbob\n  .path('friends.alice.friends.bob.name')\n  .on(function (name) {\n    console.log(\"Bob's name:\", name)\n  })\n\nAuthor/Books\nYou're an online bookstore keeping records of authors and the books they write. A book in the database might look like this:\nvar book = {\n  title: 'The Martian',\n  published: 1391238000000,\n  author: { '#': 'authors/Andy_Weir' }\n}\n\nAnd each author might look something like this...\nvar weir = {\n  name: 'Andy Weir',\n  books: {\n    'The Martian': { '#': 'books/The_Martian' }\n  }\n}\n\nHere you are again, circular reference.\nvar weir = book.author.books.The_Martian.author\n\nIn GUN\nHere's how you'd do it with gun:\n// Get a reference to the book.\nvar book = gun.get('books/The_Martian');\n\n// Set it's information.\nbook.put({\n  title: 'The Martian',\n  published: 1391238000000\n})\n\n// Get a reference to the author.\nvar weir = gun.get('authors/Andy_Weir');\n\n// Add some author information.\nweir.put({\n  name: 'Andy Weir',\n  books: {}\n})\n\n// Set the author to point to Andy Weir.\nbook.path('author').put(weir);\n\n// Add the book as a unique member of\n// Weir's \"books\" list.\nweir.path('books').set(book);\n\n// Print the author's name!\nbook.path('author.name').on(function (name) {\n  console.log('Author:', name)\n})\n\n\nWrapping things up, graphs can do some pretty awesome stuff, and are powerful for beginners and masters alike.\nHopefully that gives you a good place to start, and an idea of how gun works.

This might sound confusing, but it is actually pretty simple.\nFor instance, take this object.\n{\n  age: 23,\n  hacker: true,\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\"\n}\n\nMetadata\nThis object is composed of field and value pairs, where a value is always either null, true or false, a number or decimal, a string, or a relation. For clarity, GUN will use a consistent [[vocabulary|Glossary]], where values are primitives that get saved as a whole update on their field.\nIn order for GUN to deterministically converge on an update across many decentralized peers, it has to hold meta data about the fields and their values. This meta data is included in the GUN object itself, objects in GUN are called a node.\n{\n  _: {},\n  age: 23,\n  hacker: true,\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\"\n}\n\nThat meta data is stored on the reserved _ field. \nSoul\nEvery node also must have a universally unique ID, called a soul, which is also stored in the meta data under the reserved # field. Like so:\n{\n  _: {'#':'ASDF'},\n  age: 23,\n  hacker: true,\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\"add another node to the system.\n}\n\nFor the sake of comprehension, our example is using a very short soul. Souls should never be this short, and should be generated as a UUID or GUID or as some sufficiently long random alphanumeric string. They also should never conflict with any other node in any other app that uses GUN - more on this later. But first:\n{\n  _: {\n    '#':'ASDF',\n    '>': {}\n  },\n  age: 23,\n  hacker: true,\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\"\n}\n\nHypothetical Amnesia Machine (HAM) State\nNext up now is the meta data for the Hypothetical Amnesia Machine, reserved as the > field. This contains a copy of all the fields that have been on the node, with their corresponding convergence states. Such as:\n{\n  _: {\n    '#':'ASDF',\n    '>': {\n      age: 2,\n      hacker: 2,\n      name: 2\n    }\n  },\n  age: 23,\n  hacker: true,\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\"\n}\n\nThere you go, that is a complete GUN node. Since GUN can sync on partial nodes, you get a very clean and lean way to perform delta updates. You only have to send the diff of a node and not the whole node itself. Now let us look back at the original object and try to do the following:\n{\n  age: 23,\n  friend: {\n    hacker: true,\n    name: \"Shreyas Raman\"\n  },\n  hacker: true,\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\"\n}\n\nGraph\nWhat GUN will do, is it will denormalize it into a subset of JSON which is called a graph. We are going to hide the HAM meta data from our view for sake of clarity.\n{\n  'ASDF': {\n    _: {'#':'ASDF'},\n    age: 23,\n    friend: {'#':'FDSA'}\n    hacker: true,\n    name: \"Mark Nadal\"\n  },\n  'FDSA': {\n    _: {'#':'FDSA'},\n    hacker: true,\n    name: \"Shreyas Raman\"\n  }\n}\n\nYou can see that we flatten the object into a graph, which has field and node pairs. The fields on a graph correspond to the soul of the node it has. But how do we maintain who Mark's friend is? Well, we mentioned that a primitive value can also be a relation. A relation has a very simple structure, it is an object with just a soul field on it.\n{'#': 'FDSA'}\n\nThe value of that field is the soul of the node that it points to. Since souls are universally unique, they could point to data within your app or outside of it. This subset of JSON allows us to serialize a web of data, including circular references! Now, finally, there is only one thing beyond a graph:\n{\n  ...\n}\n\nThe graph of all graphs over all time, called the universe. However, since a single machine cannot process that much data simultaneously, we must distribute the data across many machines, each focusing on some finite graph over a particular interval of time. These graphs contain nodes which hold the actual fields and values we are interested in, as well as the meta data to guarantee convergences.\nla Fin\nAnd there you go, ladies and gentleman. From the smallest atom all the way up to a universe of data. Expressed succinctly in simple permutations of value, field, node, graph.

Read if you want a high level overview of the concepts.\nIntroduction\nWe had a discussion on gitter on how to handle security in GUN, a peer-to-peer database. Before we start, let's present some figures we are going to work with. We have:\n\nFrodo a nice person who totally trusts Gandalf and shares things with Samwise.\nGandalf trusted friend of Frodo.\nSamwise trusted by Frodo but not for everything.\nSauron not trusted by anyone, has eyes everywhere.\nGollum doing what he can but often making a mess around him.\n\nThe security question contains multiple parts:\nHow do we avoid someone masquerading as someone else ?\nThe chat example is easy to understand: we do not want messages that seem to originated from Gandalf to actually be from Sauron. A game is another issue where player 1 (Sauron) could send position updates to player 2 (Frodo) and win by cheating.\nHow do we protect sensitive data from being read by unauthorised people ?\nThe plan of action discussed by Frodo and Gandalf should not be seen by Sauron, right ? Real-world issues are countless but we can list a few: medical information, a book in the making, notes on your sex life, etc.\nHow do we share sensitive data with a group ?\nGandalf and Frodo started exchanging messages and then Samwise joins the group and they want him to be able to read all their past and present exchanges.\nHow do we avoid app spamming ?\nIf the database is not linked to a central (filtering and authenticating) authority, how do we avoid someone filling it up with junk data such as: \"My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious, My Precious\" ? Or simply someone writing null to every part of the database until the peer-to-peer sync erases all the data in everyone's copy.\nIn a gaming scenario, how do we avoid DOS (Denial Of Service) attacks like this ?\nSome key concepts\nAsymmetric or public-key cryptography\nA public key allows anybody to encrypt something but only the private key can be used to decrypt. How and why this works is like a fairy tail with lots of strange animals (elliptic curve is one of them).\ndata + public key ==> unreadable junk\nunreadable junk + private key ==> data\nDigital signature\nThis is the process by which a user can verify that a message really originated from a given user. Say Frodo receives a letter from Gandalf, he wants to be sure Gandalf actually wrote every single word of the letter. Digital signatures work like this:\nmessage + private key ==> signature (short junk like piece of text)\nmessage + signature + public key ==> true / false\nAnswers !\nNow that we have our playground setup, let's try to answer some of our initial questions.\nHow to avoid someone masquerading as someone else ?\nGandalf and Frodo want to post news in the Shire about their adventures and they want to make sure the readers can check if these messages are legit.\nEach of them hides in their home, sits down and throws stuff around randomly while shaking the key pair generator. They must shake and to random stuff otherwise someone might find a way to generate the same keys from the pair generator. Now each of them has his own public and private key pair:\nGandalf: gandalf.pub, gandalf.priv\nFrodo: frodo.pub, frodo.priv\nBefore leaving the Shire, Gandalf and Frodo give their public keys (gandalf.pub, frodo.pub) to everyone. They also publish these keys in the big book of known keys. And to make sure everyone recognises the link between these specific public keys and themselves, they create some selfies (showing the keys as QR codes on their T-Shirts). Feeling joyful, they even make a song using the first ten letters of their public keys.\nDuring their perilous adventures, they send back news and jokes to the Shire by signing the message (see Digital Signature) with their private keys. This is what happens when Gandalf signs a message and someone in the Shire checks it for authenticity (remember, here the message is not encrypted):\nGandalf: (message, gandalf.priv) ==> (message, signature) ==> Shire\nShire:   (message, signature)    ==> check (message, signature, gandalf.pub) ==> true / false\nHow do we protect sensitive data from being read by unauthorised people ?\nIf the scenario is simply Gandalf sending a private message to Frodo, this is what he does:\nGandalf: (message, frodo.pub) ==> unreadable junk\nFrodo:   (unreadable junk, frodo.priv) ==> Gandalf's message\nThis is the basic principle of asymmetric cryptography. This is what https is all about. But there is a catch: Gandalf must be certain that he is using Frodo's public key. In this case, it's ok since they met and exchanged the keys. But when Samwise joins the batch, Gandalf does not have his public key. How can he get it, making sure Sauron does not intercept messages and exchanges keys (man in the middle attack):\nGandalf: \"Samwise, send me your public key, I have a message for you\"\nSamwise: \"Sure\"\n(samwise.pub) ==> Sauron hooked on the network ==> (sauron.pub) ==> Gandalf\nGandalf: \"Thanks, here is the message\"\n(message, sauron.pub) ==> junk ==> Sauron (junk, sauron.priv) ==> message (Sauron reads the message)\n                                          (message, samwise.pub) ==> junk ==> Samwise\nAs we see, Sauron is intercepting all communications and decrypting, reencrypting all messages. One way to solve this is to use a \"known authority\" to sign the public key. Frodo could do it by signing a message containing Samwise's public key:\nFrodo: (\"Hi Gandalf, this is Samwise's public key: LKJASFASLFIO...\", frodo.priv) ==> signed message\nAnother solution is to use social media to post the public key (since it would be hard for an attacker to control all of a users social network accounts, post the fake key there and not having the user notice).\nHow do we share sensitive data with a group ?\nThis is where the RING comes into play ! If we want to encrypt communication within a possibly large group of people, we cannot encrypt each and every message with every user's public key. So what we do is we generate a public/private key pair, just for this project. Let's call this project.pub and project.priv.\nWhen writing messages to the group, authorised users encrypt the messages with the project.pub key. When they need to read, they use the project.priv key.\nIn order to grant access to the project to a newcomer (Samwise), Frodo or Gandalf simply add the project keys to Samwise's keyring. How do they do this ?\nGandalf: (project.priv, samwise.pub) ==> project-samwise.junk ==> public storage of Samwise keyring\nSamwise: (project-samwise.junk, samwise.priv) ==> project.priv\nTo revoke access, a new key pair must be created and content has to be reencrypted with the new project keys.\nNotice that we do not need to encrypt the project.pub key. And even though the data is now encrypted, it should still be signed (to know who wrote what in the group).\nHow do we avoid app spamming ?\nTODO...\n"},"more-about-gun/how-writes-are-handled.html":{"url":"more-about-gun/how-writes-are-handled.html","title":"How Writes Are Handled","keywords":"","body":"How Writes Are Handled\nPartials\nPartials are a really important concept for more than just their convenience. There is actually a lot of math and concurrency benefits to them, but we will not explore that here. Instead, we will go over how it practically impacts your life and makes things easier.\nTo illustrate, take the example:\nvar mark = gun.put({\n  username: \"marknadal\",\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\",\n  email: \"mark@gunDB.io\"\n});\n\nIn most databases, if you were to then do:\nmark.put({\n  hacker: true,\n  country: \"USA\"\n});\n\nIt would completely wipe out all your data previously there and replace it with that new object. This is fundamentally bad beyond just it not being the behavior you intended, it can also cause race conditions. Which is why most other databases are centralized around one master.\nBut we are not like that, not only because we want a bunch of your users to simultaneously interact with data, but also because that is the pattern you expect. No need to constantly do some .update({find: 'foobar'}, {$set: {just: \"my stinking location\"}}) command.\nAdditionally, if you did want such behavior, it is much more explicit to declare .update({find: 'foobar'}, null).update({find: 'foobar'}, {some: \"new object\"}). As a result, gun accepts partial updates by default and preserves your data unless you explicitly null it out.\nPartials let you work with your data without having to redownload the whole snapshot every time. Which is a common work around for dealing with cache invalidation in other databases. Even still, it is a poor one because it does not properly control for the concurrency during the latency of the expensive round trip of the data.\nIn conclusion, partials rock. Enjoy the freedom and flexibility of using them.\nCircular References\nSimilarly, you might be familiar with doing something like:\nvar mark = {\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\",\n  gender: \"male\"\n};\nvar amber = {\n  name: \"Amber Nadal\",\n  gender: \"female\",\n  husband: mark\n};\nmark.wife = amber;\n\nAnd then somewhere down the road you attempt to JSON.stringify(mark) and you get some nasty circular reference error. This is also silly, if the algorithm is smart enough to catch infinite recursions then it is trivial to serialize it properly. GUN does this for you, using the power of graphs. It is nothing fancy, it is the same thing that the web does - two webpages can link to each other.\nUnfortunately, JSON was designed with a documented oriented structure in mind, otherwise known as a tree. This was also a fatal flaw of many NoSQL databases. Working with JSON is great for developers, since our minds easily grasp the behavior of documents. But storing data as a tree creates a nightmare of usability if and when the developer wants to do anything remotely more advanced.\nGUN makes this easy, all you have to do is use that mark object you created earlier:\ngun.put(mark).key('user/marknadal');\n\nThis will save both mark and amber. However it does not create an index for Amber, so we should do that also:\ngun.get('user/marknadal').path('wife').key('user/ambernadal');\n\nThis lets us do some crazy fun inception things like:\ngun.get('user/ambernadal')\n  .path('husband.wife.husband.wife.name')\n  .val(function(name){\n    console.log(name); // \"Amber Nadal\"\n});\n\nIn conclusion, graphs rock. Enjoy the using both relational and documented structured data.\n"},"more-about-gun/the-mesh-network-protocol.html":{"url":"more-about-gun/the-mesh-network-protocol.html","title":"The Mesh Network Protocol","keywords":"","body":"The Mesh Network Protocol\nFrom the gitter:\nGUN's messaging algorithm is based off a full mesh network\nbut it works out nicely and self-mitigates against rebroadcasting the same message too many times.\nI'm going to use very specific examples\nlet me find a table really quickly\nfirst example is the common example:\nAlice is connected to Server.\nBob is connected to Server.\nvia Server, Alice is connected to Bob and vice versa.\nThe default network is VERY meshy, because the goal is that you can (later) intelligently only connect to fingers to mitigate things. The important part is creating an emergent system that works in all cases as the base case, and then can be fine-tuned/optimized for specific cases.\nso let's say Alice saves some data\nshe's only connected to 1 peer\nso she blasts that delta (change set) out to the Server\nit is in a message envelope\nwhich contains an ID for that message.\nthe server receives the message\nand checks to see if the ID exists in a small fixed-size in-memory list.\nthe ID does not exist.\ntherefore the Server then broadcasts it out to all the peers it is connected to. (NOTE: Intentional! However for security purposes you might not want this, so that is why you'd add an authorization filter. But we're not talking about this. We're talking about the case case).\nthat means Server broadcasts BACK to Alice and to Bob.\nAlice now receives her own message\nbut she doesn't know it is her own\n(well, she could, but base case is that she doesn't have to)\nAlice checks to see if the message ID is in her small fixed-size in-memory list.\nit is (cause she had added that ID to the list when she originally sent the message)\nbecause it already exists in her list\nshe does 2 things\n1) bumps the ID to the top of the list (this is a fixed-size list, so the oldest data gets flushed/removed away to save memory). Bumping the ID to the top is very important because it represents the liveliness of the data, and for lively data you want to reduce re-broadcasts.\n2) she does NOT rebroadcast.\nthe message rebroadcasting has now terminated with Alice.\nfor the peers she's connected to\nHOWEVER, the Server had also sent that same message to Bob\nBob receives it\nchecks his msg ID list\nit isn't there\ntherefore he rebroadcasts it to the peers he's connected to.\nthe msg ID goes BACK up to the Server.\nthe Server checks its ID list and sees it already exists and does 2 things:\n1) bumps the ID to the top of the list to keep it \"alive\" for deduplication.\n2) Deduplicates by NOT rebroadcasting.\nnow every peer in the network has successfully received the message while also mitigate rebroadcast storms. This algorithm works quite nicely, but can very very easily be upgraded and optimized for specific use cases and fine tuning. Like.... if you want the network traffic to NOT be anonymous, you can tag the IDs of the peers in the msg envelope so that way receive peers do an exclusion from the peer list they rebroadcast to (this cuts the echo out) however can expose identity (which might be okay for some apps). You can also limit rebroadcasts to X number of peers, like have peers only ever rebroadcast to 6 peers even if they're connected to a 100. Or only have every peer have 6 connections. Etc.\nHowever, we're not done yet!\nall we've done is UDP level fire-and-forget\nbut Alice SAVED data\nshe needs to know the data got saved.\nthe echo of her ID is not an ACK.\nhehe\nso when the Server processes the message (and depending upon clock drift, the messages might be shoved into historical/operating/future states and processed at \"different states\")...\nif the server successfully saves the data it then sends a NEW message\nwith a NEW ID\nbut with a reply-to field of the OLD ID.\nthis message (without intelligence/identity optimization) gets broadcasted to all the peers it is connected to\nAlice and Bob\nAlice receives the message and sees that it is a reply-to her original save ID (which she has stored in a separate list)\nshe now has an ACK from 1 peer that her data got replicated\ntechnically the algorithm though says that she also rebroadcast this reply message to all her peers (since the deduplication/mitigation happens first, not last). If so, she rebroadcasts the message to all her peers (in this case only the Server) which the server receives and sees that the msg ID is in its already-existing msg ID list. And thus doesn't rebroadcast. There are no acks to acks.\nhowever it would be trivial to make it slightly more intelligent that Alice knowing it is her own message (from her other list) that she could stop rebroadcasting then and there.\nMeanwhile.... Bob also receives the Server ack\nsees it isn't in his message list (but adds it to it) and rebroadcasts again (back to the Server) which receives it and sees that it is in the message list and halts.\nnow the Server's ACK has successfully been sent to all peers (NOTE: this is assuming that the network has been reliable this whole time!!! ooo-ooo-aaahh--aahhh! Fun CAP Theorem stuff. Don't worry that is covered too).\nbut now we have to deal with BOB's ACK to Alice's original save request which he received via the middle peer of the Server.\nBOB then saves the data (well in the real world, browser peers will only save the data to their localStorage only if it is a key they are already subscribed too. But again lets stick to the base-case)\nand after a successful save ACKS back a new MSG ID with a reply-to to the OLD msg ID.\nthe only peer he is connected to is the Server, which doesn't have it in its message list so it rebroadcasts it to everybody (including back to Bob which does have it and then bumps&halts), and to Alice... who also rebroadcasts it (back to the Server which now does have it and then bumps&halt) and Alice also sees that it is a ACK to her save requests and now knows that she's gotten 2 replications.\nfinally\nwe're done.\nthat is ONE scenario, with limited peers, a star configuration (peers connected to a middleman of the server), and with no network hiccups.\nFortunately this algorithm works for every configuration which is great, however it is not always the most intelligent or savvy for all setups. But thankfully again, it can be fine tuned to get better performance.... but as a base-case it mitigates message flooding and infinite-loops.\nI think so! Please do, cause I should get this up on the docs.\nNOW, to handle network hiccups. I'm not going to go over the full thing again, I'm just going to explain the rules.\nthe peer that created the data and wants it replicated is SOLEY responsible for retries if it hasn't received ACKs that it wants.\nNo other peer is responsible for retrying messages.\nSo it is very very very important for the peer trying to replicate data out that the hold onto that data as much as possible until they at least get an ACK. What this means is that it is important that the peer (no matter how \"weak\" it is, like a browser) does store their un-ACKed data at least, at minimum, in something like localStorage (which only has 5mb).\nso it has a responsbility to prioritize persistence until it gets ACKs, and even if it does get ACKs it should still probably store a replica of the data (in case the other peers fail/corrupt).\nbut saying that the initiating peer has the retry responsibility simplifies things greatly.\nso if it doesn't get an ack... it can retry. In which case, the retry runs through the same algorithm.\nNow, network hiccups.\n*sorry peers crashing/rebooting\n^retries are covered with network hiccups.\nwhat happens if we have new peers join while this is happening?\nwhat happens if a peer crashes and restarts?\nworse case is that the Server crashes\nand its fixed-size msg ID list was in memory only\nso when it comes back online it has forgotten which messages have already been in a broadcast storm\nso two quick cases:\nif the server crashes AFTER the whole process is done and comes back online. Than whoopty-doo, the message rebroadcasting has already been sent to all peers and been mitigated.\nIt doesn't really matter that it has lost its history, cause that message won't resurface.\nHOWEVER, if the server crashes WHILE its connected peers are still running this\nthe connected peers then \"echo back\" the msg ID that it (the server) just sent to them....\nthe Server goes ahead and rebroadcasts it AGAIN (while adding it to its seen list)\nbut that is okay\nbecause all of the peers it is connected to have already seen it so they halt it.\nunless of course if 2 of the neighbor peers crash while this is happening... then one of them might not know that it has seen it and rebroadcast. But the moral of the story is that the rebroadcast storms are neighbor-walled actually.\nwhich is a good thing.\nso for instance (new example)\nif I have a peer which is connected to 3 other people\nand each 3 other people are connected to a DIFFERENT 2 other people.\nugggh, hmm.\nhow do I explain this\nimagine a wave\nlike a literal water droplet dropping into water\nit creates a wave rippling outwards\nthe wave doesn't reverse back in\nbecause it interferes with itself (this is also what happens at the particle level with photons in quantum mechanics)\nthe interference BACK into the center of the wave... mitigates the wave from spreading where it has already been seen\nbut where it hasn't been seen.... it keeps rippling out\nso back to the example...\nServer is in the center of 3 other peers (Alice, Bob, Carl)\nServer rebroadcasts the message out to Alice Bob Carl\nit crashes and restarts before Alice Bob Carl echo back\nso it thinks it hasn't seen the message yet\nso it rebroadcasts back out to Alice Bob and Carl\nbut since all of Server's neighbor peers have already seen the message, they DON\"T re-emit it again. So it gets halted. It didn't really matter that the server crashed and restarted. This is the importance of the priority bump on the msg ID... to indicate the liveliness of the message storm.\nso let's say Alice was connected to Dave & Fred\nBob was connected to Evan & Gabe\nCarl was connected to Hugh & Ian.\nthe FIRST time that Server rebroadcasted to Alice&Bob&Carl. Server crash&restarts before A&B&C echo back....\nthe echo back from A&B&C is also the rebroadcast that A&B&C did to THEIR neighbor peers. Which receive the message and echo back.\nbut the echo back of the 2-degrees-separated don't come back to Server, cause A&B&C mitigate it (since they've already seen it since they delivered it to D&E&F&G&H&I)\nthis works nicely too\nbecause even if server (and my use of \"server\" here is just a name. It has not special meaning.... let's say that they are ALL servers)\nbecause even if server crashes AND Gabe crashes\nif they restart and have forgotten they've seen the ID\nthey'll rebroadcast\nbut their neighbors will mitigate\nso Server's forgotten-and-rebroadcasted message won't get to Gabe again. And Gabe's forgotten-and-rebroadcasted wont' get back to Server's.\nThis is great. Because it literally behaves as a wave.\nAhmed Fasih @fasiha 10:57\n:clap: It seems complicated but it's actually the simplest possible thing\nMark Nadal @amark 10:57\nand that feature happens because of the msg ID priority bump that keeps the msg ID's lively broadcast storm from constantly being mitigated.... until it truly does die off and becomes so \"old\" in the fixed-size msg ID list that it gets purged. At which point it is safe to purge because there is not broadcast storm.\ndone\nyupe, and most emergent for smarter and more intelligent behavior!\n(the smarter/intelligent behavior can be added on top)\n"},"more-about-gun/conflict-resolution.html":{"url":"more-about-gun/conflict-resolution.html","title":"Conflict Resolution","keywords":"","body":"Conflict Resolution\nThe conflict resolution algorithm (also called HAM) is at the center of everything gun does. It's how peers eventually arrive at the same state, and how offline edits are merged. Every change in the system goes through HAM.\nBefore reading this, we recommend you read through this tech talk, which explains the high level concepts in easy to understand terms. Also, check out the primer on our CAP Theorem tradeoffs.\nFinally, for those of you who know of Kyle Kingsbury (Aphyr), here are some good tweets about us from him. We are building out Jepsen tests with PANIC, our distributed testing framework.\nRequirements\nThese are the constraints HAM operates under.\nOffline-First\nFavor high-availability over strong consistency, allowing users to make edits even when the machine is entirely offline (like a cellphone user without a network connection). This immediately rules out group consensus algorithms like  Paxos) or Raft.\nOrdering\nThe same state should be reached regardless of what order updates arrive in (update commutativity).\nConflict Handling\nWhen merge conflicts happen, every machine should independently choose the same value (Strong Eventual Consistency).\nImplementation\nUltimately, we want to accept an update and merge it into our own data. Since gun's data structure is graph-oriented, updates will be in graph-format.\nBecause graphs only contain nodes, and nodes only contain key-value pairs, if we know how to merge key-value pairs, we can merge nodes, and in turn we can merge graphs. This means we'll focus on merging key-value pairs.\nA key-value pair is atomic to HAM, meaning it won't try to merge primitives together, it'll just choose which to keep. Choosing is the tricky part, and requires an extra bit of metadata, called state. State is used to determine ordering of updates, and is always relative to the machine which receives it (including the machine creating the update).\nLet's consider an example:\nWe have a node with one property, \"name\", a value of \"Alice\", and a state of 10.\n{\n    \"name\": {\n        \"value\": \"Alice\",\n        \"state\": 10\n    }\n}\n\nWe get an update that lists \"alice\" as \"Allison\" and state as 8. Since the update state is less than our current state, we list it as only historically important, and don't include it in our data.\n\nUnless you're using a journaling plugin, historical updates are ignored.\n\nThere's a bit more nuance to updates with greater state, so we'll discuss that in a bit. The next obvious question is what happens when we get an update with the same state as us, but with a conflicting value?\nConflicts\nWell, according to the goals we listed, it doesn't matter what value we choose, so long as everyone chooses it. We just need to be consistent. Another advantage is that gun supports a subset of JSON, so we only need to handle conflicts in that subset.\nThis allows us to define some simple rules that guarantee convergence, mostly through type and lexical comparisons. Here is a layman explanation, followed by more details:\n\nBoth are lexically equal\nThen there's no conflict, it doesn't matter which you choose.\nThey are lexically unequal\nCompare their string values with JSON.stringify, choosing the greater of the two.\nStates\nThis is dangerous territory, and if handled wrong can expose crippling application vulnerabilities. For example, a devious user submits an update with a state of 10 zillion. Now, no one gets to write until their state reaches 10 zillion plus 1.\nThat's generally frowned on. Check out this layman explainer:\n\nHAM handles this with machine relative vector. When the \"10 zillion\" update comes in, HAM simply waits until your machine reaches the state of 10 zillion before acknowledging it's existence. If an update isn't acknowledged, it never escapes volatile memory onto disk. We call this a deferred update.\nThis is good, because if no other machines have reached that state, the attacker will have no advantage over any other machine in the system. Their update intentionally remains volatile, giving the attacker only two options - retry with a non-malicious state that is closer to other machines, or bare the responsibility of keeping the update safe themselves until other machines catch up.\nIt turns out this vector can be calculated for any linear value. Numbers, decimals, alphabets, or even with timestamps - which should sound scary. Timestamps are dangerous, since:\n\nSystem time doesn't always move forward (NTP corrections).\nClock synchronization isn't always reliable.\nSome clocks move faster than others.\nYour system time might be off by any amount (especially when considering user meddling).\n\nOne of the constraints with HAM is that synchronization algorithms should not be required, including NTP and it's variants, so accurate clocks can never be assumed.\nLuckily, HAM doesn't care if your clock is accurate. It only cares about machine relative ordering, and whether an update should be part of history, current state, or ignored until some point in the future. For a layman explanation of this, check this video out:\n\nState Boundaries\nEach value is compared to the state of the last update and the state of your device's current loose clock.\nBack to our username example:\n{\n    \"name\": {\n        \"value\": \"Alice\",\n        \"state\": 10\n    }\n}\n\nSay your system clock is at state 15.\n\nWe're using smaller numbers than Date.now() because they're easier to mentally compare and reason about, but they have the same mathematical properties.\n\nHistorical State\nAny update with a state less than the last update (10) is considered stale and no longer relevant - if wanted, it can be journaled.\n// This update is too old.\nvar update = {\n    name: {\n        value: \"Allison\",\n        state: 8,\n    },\n}\n\nOperating State\nAny update with state greater than the last update (10), yet less than your process state (15) is immediately merged. The state of the last update now becomes what we just merged to (12).\n// Sweet spot!\n// This will be merged.\nvar update = {\n    name: {\n        value: \"Alicia\",\n        state: 12,\n    },\n}\n\nDeferred State\nAny update with a state greater than your system clock (15) is considered deferred, and won't be processed until your clock reaches that point. The further it is into the future, the larger vector it has in terms of distance before being processed.\n// Nope, ignore this until the\n// clock reaches state `22`.\nvar update = {\n    name: {\n        value: \"Ally\",\n        state: 22,\n    },\n}\n\nApplying It\nMerging two nodes can be done by iterating over each field of an update, and deciding which field to choose: the one you already have, or the one proposed by the update.\nIf an update node has a field that the source object doesn't, the source node's field state is assumed to be -Infinity, meaning you always add that new field.\nThe same process can be repeated for graphs, iterating over each node in an update graph and merging it with the source.\nYou can find the HAM implementation in gun.js under the name function HAM.\nConsiderations\nHAM doesn't guarantee multi-process linearizability because in highly-available systems, you don't know when all updates have finished network propagation. Instead, it guarantees Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC). If linearizability is necessary, either use a consensus system like Paxos (sacrificing availability), or explicitly build it into your data using linked lists, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), or others.\n\nNo Strong Consistency, linearizability, or serializability.\nVulnerable to the Double Spending problem.\n\nQuestions\nIf you want more information about how the conflict engine works, you can message us on Gitter or post a question on Stack Overflow with the #gun tag.\nFurther Reading\n\nWhere gun stands on the CAP theorem.\nSome challenges to distributed operations.\nWhy banks are not ACID.\nConcerns about timestamps (Aphyr).\nEventual Consistency vs Strong Eventual Consistency vs Strong Consistency.\n\nAgain, we strongly recommend you check out the tech talk.\n"},"more-about-gun/position-on-the-cap-theorem.html":{"url":"more-about-gun/position-on-the-cap-theorem.html","title":"Position on the CAP Theorem","keywords":"","body":"Position on the CAP Theorem\nThis is not a discussion on what the CAP Theorem is, but on the tradeoffs that GUN decides to default to. Mark gave a great talk on this in Berlin, which explains everything in easy to understand terms. Kyle Kingsbury (Aphyr) of the Jepsen tests was there, and he tweeted about us.\nAP\nGUN is an AP system by default, this means GUN can successfully read and write data even if other peers are offline. As a result, GUN is not strongly consistent in linearizable ways. Instead, it is eventually consistent in order to be highly available to users regardless of connectivity. When connectivity is or becomes available again, GUN will synchronize data at low latency using at least once delivery to guarantee that all peers will deterministically converge to the same data within a time frame, without any extra coordination or gossip.\nEventual Consistency\nAs mentioned, GUN opts for eventual consistency. This means that if two people on opposite sides of the world modified the same piece of data at the \"same time\", they would not know about each other's conflicting updates until the information had propagated to them over the slow network. Meaning their updates will not resolve to a \"consistent\" view until some amount of time has passed. Why is this the case? Because physics cannot break the speed of light, meaning instantaneous communication is impossible in all known sciences.\nStrong Consistency\nSo how is strong consistency possible, then? It is built ontop of a messaging system that is eventually consistent. These messages broadcast a \"lock\" request to all peers for the data to be modified (this example ignores potential lock request conflicts). The peers \"ack\" back accepting the data lock, meaning they will not allow local users to read or write on that data, resulting in high latency for the user. Once the original peers has received unanimous approval, it will then write the data and wait till it hears back success from the peers. The following two things can be observed from this:\n\nThat system is not highly available, if there is a network partition (aka if any one peer cannot be reached) the data cannot be said to be consistent without waiting an indefinite amount time.\nStrong consistency is an emergent property of an eventually consistent messaging system. Meaning GUN could evolve into a CP system at the loss of being highly available.\n\nLinearizability\nWhile the last point is interesting, it is not recommended that one evolves GUN into a locking system. Instead, new research in Convergent Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Operational Transformation (OT or WOOTs), and some Block Chain Ledgers provide similar guarantees without simulating any centralized mechanisms. These systems declare the \"dependent causality\" explicitly in the data, rather than the protocol - and thus should be preferred since they give you some form of linearizability without sacrificing the advantages of a peer-to-peer system. See this article for more details.\nSummary\nGUN is AP with eventual consistency by default, but it is possible to upgrade into a CP system but it is not recommended. Instead, one should apply some form of \"dependent causality\" into the data itself at the application layer manually or as a module that wraps it for you.\nAgain, we recommend you check out the tech talk. After you have read it, check out the documentation on how it is implemented, here.\n"},"more-about-gun/sharding.html":{"url":"more-about-gun/sharding.html","title":"Sharding","keywords":"","body":"Sharding\nGUN generally considers sharding as *not a good thing.\n*With the exception that you are running your own physical machines. Let's talk about that and lay out the landscape.\n1. Database as a Service\nSuch as Compose, Heroku's Postgres, Dropbox Datastore, Firebase, Parse, etc.\n2. Deployed Database in the Cloud\nThis is where you spin up a box on AWS EC2, Google Cloud Engine, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, etc. and install and maintain your own database - such as MySQL, MongoDB, RethinkDB, etc.\n3. On your own Physical Machine\nWhile similar to (2), you ultimately own the hardware which you do deployments on - where when resources run low, you have to physically add hard drives.\nAdvantages\nThe advantage of (1) is that (2) and (3) may be hard and difficult, which is why DevOps and SysAdmins are critical roles. Database as a Services outsource these roles for you with the downside of typically being expensive when you surpass the freemium tier, slower network latency, and not owning your data.\nThe advantage of (3) is that you own your data, which for security or regulatory concerns might be necessary. It suffers a serious pain point though, upfront costs and manual intervention as well as extensive knowledge across disciplines.\nDeploying to the cloud is the middle ground, you are paying to outsource the physical work and take advantage of provisioning as many virtual machines as possible. The important distinction is that things are virtualized, whether that be the computation or the storage - meaning the cloud provider has abstracted the scaling of these resources for you.\nObservations\nTraditionally database servers had to be provisioned, acting as a transactor for data on one or more disks. To be precise, this transactor is an abstraction and virtualization layer for storing structured data. That way the application developer does not have to worry about storage location. But cloud providers have already virtualized storage, such as S3 or GCS or Azure Storage which are \"infinite\" hard drives. This is not to say that fixed size allocated disks are unavailable, they are - and significantly faster, but the constraints on their size are arbitrarily limited by the underlying virtualization.\nThese arbitrary constraints are the very things that the database and cloud are trying to remove. Yet because there is such a prevalent expectation that things are limited, people keep resorting to finite drives by default. And how do you get around those defaults? By chunking data into tiny fixed sizes and storing and replicating them on a growing set of hard drives that are dedicated to a specific \"shard\" key or range. This is when sharding is necessary, such as when you run your own physical machines.\nMisconception\nIronically, despite the scalability of the cloud's storage, people still deploy and shard databases across finite drives on these providers. This results in sharding still being a common practice, but has the following two unfortunate disadvantages with only one advantage:\n\nA. You pay for compute time as well as the total allocated storage cost rather than storage used.\nB. You still need devops and sysadmin expertise to configure and coordinate shard keys and boxes.\nC. With the advantage of not getting locked into any proprietary virtualization system.\n\nOption (C) alone is worthwhile, but this is not a reason to suddenly start sharding on the cloud, it would be a reason to move off the cloud entirely to (3) because the underlying provisioning of machines is proprietary as well. So what? Maybe you are using the cloud to optimize cost, in which case (A) is going to cost more anyways. So no matter how you approach it, attempting to shard in the cloud is a misconception and should be avoided.\nConclusion\nTherefore GUN does not recommend sharding, as it assumes the majority of users will be deploying in the cloud. Additionally, this then removes one massive pain point for the developer - letting GUN automatically cache based on dynamic load rather than storage constraints. This makes things faster for your end user and less work for you personally.\nFinally, if you want to use GUN on your own machines (3) where you will have to shard, it is still possible via the priority and no-expiry options (documentation coming). Therefore GUN can shard when physically necessary, but it is highly recommended to be avoided everywhere else in order to reduce costs and complexity.\n"},"more-about-gun/porting-gun.html":{"url":"more-about-gun/porting-gun.html","title":"Porting Gun","keywords":"","body":"Porting Gun (Under Construction)\nWe'll walk you through creating a reduced GUN server in your language of choice. It will not be useful as a library to other developers, but it will help you understand what is going on and communicate with GUN peers. You should be able to then expand upon it, adding a nice language specific API so it is usable by other developers.\nThere are three main categories we'll need to implement for our minimal GUN server.\n\nRunning a server that speaks GUN's wire spec.\nUnderstanding and implementing GUN's graph structure.\nProcessing data through GUN's conflict resolution algorithm.\n\nThat's it! Our target implementation will be in-memory, WebSockets, JSON, and HAM.\nRunning a Server\nYour first objective is to get a WebSocket server up in your language which sends \"hello world!\" once every second to a browser which connects to it. Might as well append the count to the message as well. This tests to see if your language can do asynchronous and event driven logic. If it can't, then it will be pretty difficult to implement GUN. Hopefully your language of choice also has a WebSocket server module that somebody has written for you - if not, you can get your hands dirty and build it for everybody else or emulate WebSockets with JSONP over HTTP which we won't cover here.\nHere is the solution implemented in NodeJS:\n\nNote: Code samples throughout this entire article should be considered as more pseudo code than anything else. There is no guarantee that any of them are perfectly working.\n\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received:', message);\n  });\n  var count = 0;\n  setInterval(function(){\n    count += 1;\n    ws.send('hello world ' + count);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n\nAnd here is the code that you can paste into the browser to see if it and your WebSocket server works.\n// paste this into your browser console to test your WebSocket server!\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080'); // change this address to your server, if different!\nws.onopen = function(o){ console.log('open', o) };\nws.onclose = function(c){ console.log('close', c) };\nws.onmessage = function(m){ console.log('message', m.data) };\nws.onerror = function(e){ console.log('error', e) };\n\nYou might need to paste it into a browser tab that isn't on HTTPS or blocking cross origin. If you have problems, just wrap it into an HTML file that you save to your computer and then open it in the browser.\nBefore moving on and upgrading our WebSocket server into a GUN server, we are going to take a detour into explaining graphs with JSON.\nGraph Structure\nThe fundamental problem is that JSON does not allow for circular references, yet a graph might be full of them.\n// paste this into your browser console to see JSON explode.\nvar object = {};\nobject.self = object;\nJSON.stringify(object); // Error!\n\nIt turns out that JSON is actually a really bad choice for GUN, however it does have really good compatibility support across languages which makes it a convenient interchange format. Therefore we'll roll with it for these examples and it should work just fine.\nSo how do we get around JSON's problems? Well, quite simply we wrap everything into a root level JSON object, then give every object at every level a UUID, pull them out of their nested hierarchy into the root JSON object under their UUID, and then backfill the hierarchy with UUID pointers. Was that too much text? Here is a data example:\nvar mark = {\n  name: \"Mark Nadal\"\n}\nvar cat = {\n  name: \"Fluffy\",\n  species: \"kitty\", // for science!\n}\ncat.slave = mark;\nmark.boss = cat;\n\nAs you see, we have a fairly simple JavaScript object but it can't be serialized to JSON. If we normalize it into a graph then it won't be a problem:\nvar graph = {\n  mark: {\n    name: \"Mark Nadal\",\n    boss: {'#': 'cat'}\n  },\n  cat: {\n    name: \"Fluffy\",\n    species: \"kitty\",\n    slave: {'#': 'mark'}\n  }\n}\nJSON.stringify(graph);\n\nHere I have decided to use {'#': \"UUID\"} as the JSON format for a pointer. However, 'mark' and 'cat' are hardly universally unique - so let's fix that. If we are going to do this though, it would be wise for us to actually contain the UUID on the object itself so that way it can know its own UUID in case it gets isolated. Let's update the graph to the following:\n\nNote: For human clarity, we are going to fake the UUID with something readable. In practice, you should use a real UUID.\n\nvar graph = {\n  ASDF: {_: {'#': 'ASDF'},\n    name: \"Mark Nadal\",\n    boss: {'#': 'FDSA'}\n  },\n  FDSA: {_: {'#': 'FDSA'},\n    name: \"Fluffy\",\n    species: \"kitty\",\n    slave: {'#': 'ASDF'}\n  }\n}\nJSON.stringify(graph);\n\n\nNote: This creates a lovely structure that is always a UUID, field, and value! This winds up being very important for later sections.\n\nThere we go, now we have a nice graph. We added the _ property to each object to contain metadata, like its own UUID. It is JSON safe, which means we can serialize it between JavaScript and your WebSocket server! Let's go back to that.\nGUN Wire Spec\nNow that you know how we are going to transfer data between languages, we can upgrade the WebSocket server to speak GUN. There is only two wire commands that GUN supports - write and read. That's it, let's go over those in a little bit more detail:\n\nPUT is any write to the data. It is always pushed over the network as a graph, although different serializations than JSON might be used. There is no CRUD! All CUD are treated as the same, an update. The graph that is sent only contains the part\n\nGET is any read on the data. It is always pushed over the network as a lexical cursor, this is intended to allow for even low memory devices to process large datasets. A lexical cursor is broken down into these parts, and could be serialized differently than JSON:\n\n# UUID lexical match. For purposes here we will only handle an exact lexical match, we will not be going over the other matching conditions.\n. Field lexical match. We will not be covering this at all in this article.\n= Value lexical match. Same as above.\n> State lexical match. What are states? You'll find out soon enough.\n\n\n\n\nNote: As of the recent release of GUN v0.3.3, GET wire commands are not formatted properly. The reason why, as alluded above, is because only exact UUID matches are implemented. Thus the only thing that gets sent is the UUID whether it be a lexical cursor or not. We are fixing this.\n\nBoth PUT and GET expect acknowledgements, as you might guess. But this is where things get interesting. GUN is fully peer-to-peer, meaning regardless of whether you are running a centralized GUN server or not you have to comply by the decentralized architecture. What this means is that every wire command you receive, you also forward it along to everybody else as well.\n... TO BE CONTINUED ...\nConflict Resolution - THIS SECTION IS NOT FINISHED AND WILL PROBABLY BE ENTIRELY REWRITTEN\nAny GUN library in any language must first start with the Hypothetical Amnesia Machine, which is is the conflict resolution algorithm. Also check out the wiki page on Conflict Resolution.\nParameters:\n\nmachineState: The current time of the local machine.\nincomingState: The time of the update from the remote machine.\ncurrentState: The time of the last update on the local machine.\nincomingValue: The data coming from the remote machine.\ncurrentValue: The data stored in the local machine.\n\nfunction HAM(machineState, incomingState, currentState, incomingValue, currentValue){ // TODO: Lester's comments on roll backs could be vulnerable to divergence, investigate!\n    if(machineState \nIf you can implement this in your language of choice, then congratulations you now have a GUN driver. Everything else about GUN is pretty much just an API surface that wraps around this, providing convenience functions for the end developer. So first thing first, write this in your language of choice.\nTo recap, all data in GUN gets boiled down to these 5 parameters such that they can be compared and converged on, given the HAM results. It is an incredibly simple algorithm but it is universally detailed in how to handle data synchronization.\nHere are some slides from a Tech Talk I gave in Germany on the HAM. However it unfortunately was not recorded and may not be helpful without video or audio. I did a quick summary of it in this talk.\n"},"projects.html":{"url":"projects.html","title":"Projects","keywords":"","body":"Please edit this page and add your project - there are two sections, pending/interested in using gun and ones already using gun.
